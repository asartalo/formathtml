# formathtml

This is a fork of [alanpearce/htmlformat](https://github.com/alanpearce/htmlformat) which is itself a fork of [a-h/htmlformat](https://github.com/a-h/htmlformat). I originally did this to change the indentation from one space `" "` to two spaces `"  "`. But then my needs are highly specific so this has transformed into a monstrosity I am not proud of. Please don't use this. It is not optimized.

Maybe I will clean this up in the future but don't count on that.
